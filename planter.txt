# Planting Organizations 
Showcase your work and collect accurate field data that can boost productivity.
GreenStand is using cool new technology to boost productivity and provide accurate field data. 
 
Tree data can help you analyze your work. You can easily know
- exact number of trees planted
- where trees are planted
- your strongest planters
- long-term survival rates per planter

Coming soon:
Provide a two-way link between field workers and administrators.  This link can be used to:
-specify types of trees to plant and where to plant them.
-request updates of particular trees.
-send planters back to specific trees to collect data.
- send planters to tend to trees – water etc.
